# Using React Hooks

This repository was created while following along with the PluralSight course, Using React 17 Hooks by Peter Kellner

This project contains a lot of comments and commented out code. These serve as my notes, and as a reference to code that was refactored.

Below is the relevent information copied from the Using React Hooks course README:

Install Node 14.16 with NPM 7.9.
Clone this repository. - git clone https://github.com/pkellner/pluralsight-course-using-react-hooks or download the zip
**Set your default directory to which module you want (example: cd 02-Basic-React-Hooks-useState-useRef-useEffect - cd m6-add-rest-data-to-server-side-rendering
Install Node Packages with Dependencies. - npm install
Install this chrome extension for viewing performance data (optional).


# Course Code for [Using React Hooks](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/using-react-hooks) on Pluralsight


Before you start, you should install node on either your Windows or Mac computer (those are the two environments that are tested). Below, in
"Getting Started" are the basics to get module 6 up and running as fast as possible.


*[A new React Course from Peter Kellner "Designing React Components"](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-components-designing)*

## Course Description

React versions 17.0.2 and higher, include React Hooks which solve several problems that went unaddressed in previous versions. React Hooks provide a direct API to React concepts you already know about. Those concepts include props, state, context, refs and lifecycle events. React Hooks are designed for use in React Functional Components where previously there was no good way to manage state or lifecycle events.

In this course, you’ll learn how to use the top seven React Hooks as well as gain the knowledge and experience necessary to build your own customized composite Hook. Along the way, you’ll pick up techniques you can use building real world web apps that include how React Hooks can help you with REST services, reducers, authentication and more.

When you are finished with this course, you’ll confidently be able to combine functional components with React Hooks to build first class React apps. Those apps can be written completely with functional components and React Hooks.


## Getting Started
1. **Install [Node 14.16 with NPM 7.9](https://nodejs.org)**. 
2. **Clone this repository.** - `git clone https://github.com/pkellner/pluralsight-course-using-react-hooks` or [download the zip](https://github.com/pkellner/pluralsight-course-using-react-hooks/archive/master.zip)
3. **Set your default directory to which module you want (example: cd 02-Basic-React-Hooks-useState-useRef-useEffect - `cd m6-add-rest-data-to-server-side-rendering`
4. **Install Node Packages with Dependencies.** - `npm install`
5. **Install [this chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nextjs-utilities-extensio/ffcogmoganomoabikgmcmckdgojnpldo) for viewing performance data (optional).**



## Directory Structure Here

Each of the 5 folders here represent one module of the course.  In each folder, there are subfolders that represent the completed code at the end of each clip. Where this is no clip reference, either there is no code in that clip or nothing changed from the previous clip.

Once in a clip directory, the easiest way to test the app is to first install the packages by typing at the root of that directory (in a terminal window or DOS prompt)

`npm install`

Then, do run the app you just need type

`npm run dev`

And that will launch the web server on port 3000 where you can browser to it at the url: `http://localhost:3000`

## Background

This course uses the Next.js framework as a demonstraton vehicle for React Hooks. If you want to know more about Next.js you should watch my other course on Pluralsight titled "Building Server-side Rendered React Apps for Beginners". You can find it [here](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/building-server-side-rendered-react-apps-beginners).
